The company’s annual revenue last year was \$5 billion and growing at the rate of 10% year over year. myRetail sells general merchandise products, including a fast growing fresh grocery segment. The stores average 80,000 sq. ft. in size and carry around 20,000 products. myRetail wants to provide a multi-channel experience for its customers online.

myRetail is comparing solution options for the online grocery store. Create a web application that does the following:

- The client side code can be backbone, angular or another framework of your choice. React (additional library’s such as Redux are welcome). Use node to run the application.
- Show the add to cart button only if the item is available online, purchasingChannelCode equals 0 or 1.
- Show the pick up in store only if the item is available instore, purchasingChannelCode equals 0 or 2.
- Create a carousel to scroll through the images

### Deliverables
